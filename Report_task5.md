This repository contains the source code and steps to create a very first Flutter app using Visual Studio Code.

Steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jameel-edoo/flutter_demo.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio Code:

    ```bash
    cd flutter_demo
    code .
    ```

3. Open a terminal in VS Code and run the following command to get the dependencies:

    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```


4. Connect a device or start an emulator.


5. Run the app:

    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

This will launch the app on the connected device/emulator, and you should see the default Flutter app.
